## About Us

[ScatterHQ](https://github.com/orgs/ScatterHQ/) is a place to find former employees of [ClusterHQ](https://clusterhq.com)
and a place to find support for ClusterHQ open source software.
We're proud of what we created and we aim to maintain and improve these projects for the foreseeable future.

## Flocker

ScatterHQ will maintain a [fork of Flocker](https://github.com/ScatterHQ/flocker), an open-source Container Data Volume Manager for your Dockerized applications.

A small group of the original Flocker engineering team are available for consultation and support, including:
[Richard Wall](https://github.com/wallrj),
[Tom Prince](https://github.com/tomprince),
[Jean-Paul Calderone](https://github.com/exarkun), and
[Adam Dangoor](https://github.com/adamtheturtle).
We'll be delighted to work with you on architecture consultation, installation and configuration, training or support.

[Email us](mailto:flocker-team@scatterhq.com) if we can help.
